# common-finance-tools (WIP)
A web application that offers common financial tools like a mortgage calculator. More tools and features will be added with time.
No data will be persisted as of 9/2/2022.
Initial consideration is using a SPA to make handling data easier but a frameworkless (HTML, CSS, JS) approach may be the best route. May consider using a CSS library to improve UI/UX as a future improvement.
