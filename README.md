# common-finance-tools (WIP)
A web application that offers common financial tools like a mortgage calculator. More tools and features will be added with time.
No data will be persisted as of 9/2/2022.
Initial consideration is using a SPA to make handling data easier but a frameworkless (HTML, CSS, JS) approach may be the best route. May consider using a CSS library to improve UI/UX as a future improvement.

## Roadmap
Create Simple Mortgage Calculator
  - Import Average Interest Rate
  - Consider PMI & Property Taxes (based on State)
  - Visualize Data
 
Salary Calculator
Investment Calculator
